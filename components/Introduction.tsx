        I&apos;m a Software Engineer who builds systems that millions of people depend on. At Visa, I worked on critical financial services processing 20M+ monthly API requests, led legacy migrations that reduced technical debt by 10+ years, and architected modern payment platforms. At Wayfair, I revolutionized sales recommendation engines with 20% accuracy improvements and achieved 100% test coverage on mission-critical systems. My expertise spans the full technology stack—from React and TypeScript frontends to Spring Boot and .NET Core backends.

        What drives me isn&apos;t just writing code—it&apos;s architecting solutions that make a genuine difference. I&apos;ve built data transformation pipelines that power sales recommendations, implemented real-time messaging systems for financial services, and modernized legacy platforms to React and Next.js. Every line of code I write is with one goal: to create software that earns trust, delivers value, and makes someone&apos;s day easier, faster, or more meaningful.

        I&apos;m seeking opportunities to work on challenging problems that matter — whether that&apos;s building the next generation of financial technology, optimizing data pipelines that power millions of decisions, or creating intuitive experiences that people love to use. I thrive in environments that value innovation, technical excellence, and the kind of impact that changes how people interact with technology.
