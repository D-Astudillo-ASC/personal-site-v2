# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome! I'm Daniel Astudillo, a software engineer passionate about building things that matter and sharing what I learn along the way.

## Why Start a Blog?

For years, I've been meaning to create a space to:

- Share insights from real-world engineering work
- Document my journey and growth as a developer
- Write about projects, tools, and technologies I love
- Help others by sharing solutions to tricky problems
- Reflect on the challenges and joys of building software

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find:

- Deep dives into React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern web development
- Lessons learned from working at companies like Visa and Wayfair
- Project showcases and technical breakdowns
- Career advice, productivity tips, and personal reflections
- Occasional posts about math, design, and the creative process

## About Me

I'm a full-stack engineer with a love for clean code, thoughtful design, and continuous learning. I believe in sharing knowledge, building community, and making technology more accessible for everyone.
